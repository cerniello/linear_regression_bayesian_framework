# Linear regression in bayesian framework

I've decided to make linear regression with a dataset of 1950 on liver chyrrosis death rate

The dataset is taken from the article “Death from liver cirrhosis and specific alcoholic beverage consumption: an ecological study” written by Schmidt W., Bronetto J. and published in 1950
